# Interactive geospatial and timeseries visualization

## Objective
- Visualize longitudinal data of COVID19 (Date publicly announced of confirmed case) and geospatial footprint of cases at the barangay level.

## Notes
- Leaflet has a bunch of features for interactivity with the time dimension of data. Possible solution for visualizing the barangay-level choropleth with a time sequence may be found here.
